I got the recommendation of the website https://ramkedem.com/en/ to practice SQL questions from a close friend. 
There are 10 free questions and  100 more questions. The questions have been thoughfully picked by Mr. Ram Kedem more about him here https://ramkedem.com/en/about/
For all the questions solution(s) has also been provided on the website.  To get the information on the questions, please go to the website. 

I solved some questions  realized that these questions have decent depth and width of the SQL topics so have started to solve them. 

**The solution saved here are primarily my attempt.** They may / may not be aligned with the solution given on the website. 
They can be correct / incorrect. From my side I have done unit testing of the solutions before storing them here.
