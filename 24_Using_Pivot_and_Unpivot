;with cte1 as(SELECT * FROM OfficeCosts
unpivot (Charge /*measure*/ FOR ChargeType /*name of dimension*/ in (Cleaning,Equipment, Electricity)) As unpvt)

--SELECT OfficeCity, Year(BillDate) as BillYear, Charge, ChargeType FROM cte1

SELECT * FROM (SELECT OfficeCity, Year(BillDate) as BillYear, Charge, ChargeType FROM cte1) AS BaseData 
	PIVOT (SUM(Charge)  For ChargeType in ([Cleaning],[Equipment],[Electricity])) AS PivotData
